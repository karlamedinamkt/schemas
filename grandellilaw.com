In our experience, it is best to seek a legal consultation before providing any statements. An insurance investigator can sometimes trick an unwary accident victim into making inaccurate statements which can be used against them in any potential litigation."

In a construction accident case, it is imperative to promptly take photographs of the scene of the accident, any equipment involved in the accident, such as ladders or scaffolds, or any debris or dangerous ground surface which may have caused or contributed to the accident. In a slip/trip and fall accident at a premises, it is also necessary to promptly take photographs of the scene of the accident whether it be a defect on a floor, in a stairwell or slippery condition such as liquid, ice or another foreign substance. The pictures of the above should be taken from all angles and distances."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The process in substituting a law firm that you are not satisfied with is relatively simple. Clients often find out that it was a mistake to hire the first attorney they chose to represent them in a personal injury case. In these situations, clients are free to have any law firm of their choosing substitute the firm that was initially retained. All that is required in order to substitute the law firm that was initially hired is to have the necessary documents signed by the client and for the out-going and incoming attorneys to arrange for a transfer of the client’s file. Our firm has been selected by numerous clients over the years to substitute a law firm that the client was dissatisfied with. However, we are reluctant to substitute another law firm if that firm is handling the case in a competent and professional manner. Therefore, we will only agree to be retained in cases where we feel that we can achieve far greater results for the client."

Every case is different and the nature of the case, complexity of the issues, schedules of the attorneys, parties, witnesses, experts and Court may affect the length of time a lawsuit takes. In our experience, a 'quick settlement' often does not benefit the plaintiff, and it sometimes may take several years to achieve maximum results in cases involving severe injuries or wrongful death."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "There is limited time in the State of New York to file a personal injury lawsuit referred to as a statute of limitations. Generally, the time period for a negligence action is three years from the date of the accident, and the time period for a medical malpractice action is two and a half years from the date of the malpractice. However, the statute of limitations can be shorter if the potential defendant is the Federal Government, the State or City of New York, or one of their agencies. If the plaintiff is a minor or under a disability, it is possible that the statute of limitations will be tolled (extended). Since the statute of limitations applicable to your claim may depend upon the nature of your case we recommend that you contact us promptly so that we may advise you."

  "articleBody": "A major safety alert has emerged for New York drivers as Volkswagen announces a critical recall affecting over 114,000 vehicles due to faulty airbags. This recall is particularly concerning for drivers in Staten Island and throughout New York, where high humidity levels can accelerate the deterioration of these defective safety devices. With car accidents in New York occurring at an alarming rate – over 400,000 crashes annually – the presence of faulty safety equipment poses a significant risk to driver and passenger safety. The recall encompasses multiple Volkswagen models, including: 2006-2007 Passat Sedans, 2012-2014 Passat models, 2017 Passat Wagons, 2017-2019 Beetle and Beetle Convertible models. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), these faulty airbags contain a critical defect where the driver’s side frontal airbag inflator may explode during deployment.
